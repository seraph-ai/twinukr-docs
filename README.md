# The War in Ukraine OSINT Tracker

## Introduction

This tracker was built to help collate and verify reports, images and videos coming from press, civilians and military on the ground in Ukraine. We pull public posts from multiple Social Media sites focusing on trusted accounts with a track record for good information.

The posts are then verified by our collection of OSINT community members before being tagged to an incident that is visible on the public tracker. This method allows us to show all the posts and media related to one incident.  

## Aims

* Provide a unified portal for verified OSINT data collected from social media sources.
* Verify and tag social media posts from high quality accounts.
* Provide API's and access to data for other OSINT tools and community members.

## Features
